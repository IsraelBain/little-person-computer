# Little Person Computer (LPC) - CSCI 2122

ðŸš€ **A Virtual Machine for Simulating a Simple Computer Architecture**  

## ðŸ›  Description
This C-based project implements a **Little Person Computer (LPC)**, a simplified virtual machine that simulates the execution of assembly-like instructions. It includes **registers, memory management, control flow, and arithmetic operations**.

## ðŸ“‚ Features
âœ… Simulates a CPU with registers, memory, and program counter  
âœ… Executes low-level instructions for arithmetic, branching, and memory access  
âœ… Includes **error handling** for invalid instructions and memory access violations  
âœ… Designed with **modular functions** for clear and maintainable code  

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **C** â€“ Core language for implementation  
- **Bitwise Operations & Memory Management**  
- **File I/O & Debugging Utilities**
